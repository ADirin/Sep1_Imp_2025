## üë®‚Äçüíª Sprint 4 Scrum Master Tasks  

### **1. Finalize the Product Functionality (2 points)**  
The primary focus was to ensure all planned features were fully implemented and operational. This involved rigorous testing and debugging to address any remaining issues.  

- **Feature Implementation:** All planned features (e.g., authentication, data visualization, API integration) implemented as specified.  
- **Bug Fixing:** Resolved issues (e.g., data display errors, UI glitches, error handling) through debugging and log analysis.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Verified business logic for accuracy.  
  - Ensured UI components render and respond correctly.  
  - Validated proper data input, storage, retrieval, and display.

### **2. Create Docker Image (4 points)**  
A Dockerfile was created to containerize the entire application, including both the frontend and backend components.  

- **Dockerfile Creation:** Defined build steps, including specifying the base image, installing dependencies, copying the application code, and setting the startup command.  
- **Image Building:** Built the Docker image using the `docker build` command.  
- **Local Testing:** Verified functionality by running the image locally with the `docker run` command.

### **3. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub (1 point)**  
The Docker image was pushed to Docker Hub to make it publicly accessible.  

- **Docker Hub Account:** A Docker Hub account was created.  
- **Image Tagging:** The Docker image was tagged with the Docker Hub username and a version number.  
- **Image Pushing:** The Docker image was pushed to Docker Hub using the `docker push` command.  
- **Verification:** Confirmed the image is publicly available on Docker Hub.  

**Test Deployed Image / Docker Play:**  
- **Environment Setup:** Docker Play installed and configured locally.  
- **Deployment:** Docker image deployed to Docker Play cluster.

### **4. Share Functional Prototype with the Class (3 points)**  
After finalizing the prototype, the project was prepared and shared with classmates in **Week 8**.  

- ‚úÖ **Presentation (ppt):** Shared project following lecturer‚Äôs instructions.  
- ‚úÖ **Product Walkthrough:** Demonstrated key features and functionalities, including:  
  - Functional application  
  - Docker image and Docker Hub link  
  - Test deployment results  
  - User flow and major features  
- ‚úÖ **Feedback:** Collected and addressed peer suggestions, highlighting individual contributions and challenges overcome.  
- ‚úÖ **Finalizing Project GitHub and Trello / Jira:**  
  - Updated all documentation  
  - Completed **README** as instructed
