## Sprint Review Report – Short Guideline

### 1. Create the report
- Use a simple format (Markdown or PDF).
- Keep it short: **1–2 pages max**.
- Include the following sections:
  - **Sprint Goal**
  - **Completed User Stories / Tasks**
  - **Demo Summary** (what was shown in the review)
  - **What Went Well**
  - **What Could Be Improved**
  - **Next Sprint Focus**
  - **A table to demonstrate the time spent by each memeber during the spring**

### 2. Name the file
- Example: `Sprint_1_Review_Report.md` or `Sprint_1_Review_Report.pdf`

### 3. Upload to GitHub
- Open your **project repository** on GitHub.
- Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g. `/docs/sprint_report/` ).
- Click **Add file → Upload files**.
- Upload the report and **commit** with a clear message  
  (e.g. *“Add Sprint 1 review report”*).

### 4. Verify
- Make sure the file is visible in the repository.
