# Sprint 3: CI/CD Integration, Feature Extension, and Basic Docker Image


**AD/ 2026**

----------------------------------------------------------------
## ⚠️  NOTE FOR STUDENTS:  
- <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">In this course, the focus is more on the process of developing the product than on the final product itself.</span> Don’t worry about trying to build everything in a single sprint, that’s not the goal.  
- <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">The lecturer will take the role of Product Owner.</span> At the end of each sprint, your work will be reviewed during a dedicated Zoom session for each team, and all team members are expected to participate in the review session.
- Despite assigning points to each task, this does not mean that a team can choose some tasks and ignore others just to earn passing points. The team must implement all tasks defined in the requirements for each sprint.
- Lectures help you implement the tasks smoothly, so it is highly recommended to attend them and complete the in-class assignments.
- Use the project repository to maintain sprint reports, latest commits, and design artifacts.

##  💡Sprint 3 Objectives
This document outlines the objectives and tasks completed during Sprint 3, including:
1. Extending the functional prototype and integrating Jenkins for CI/CD,
2. Enhancing automated testing with code coverage and preparing for a functional review.

The primary goal of this sprint is to solidify the backend logic, add critical features, and establish a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous integration and delivery.

Additionally, we began creating a local Docker image for the project.

 Scrum Master tasks:**
- The **Scrum Master** will oversee team participation, AI application use, backlog updates, Sprint 2 **review preparation**, and Sprint 3 **planning submission**.
- While teams are free to determine their own approach for Sprint 3, the following examples are provided for guidance. The prioritization and sequencing of tasks will be established by the Scrum Master in collaboration with the development team.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Tasks

### 1. ✅ Extend Functional Prototype (4 points)
During this sprint, we concentrate on implementing the remaining and more complex features outlined in our original product backlog. This involved for example:

- **Feature Implementation:** We successfully implemented the following key features:
  -  Implementation of the graphical user interface (e.g., JavaFX) with database interaction.
  -  User authentication and authorization module (if essential).
  -  Other features as defined in the initial product vision and product backlog.

- **Core Functionality Validation:** We rigorously tested all core functionalities to ensure they are operational and meet the specified requirements. This included:
  - Performance testing to identify and address bottlenecks.
  - details Unit test for all funtions.

- **Bug Fixing and Optimization:** We addressed logic bugs identified during testing and optimized backend performance to improve responsiveness and scalability. This involved:
  - Profiling the application to identify performance bottlenecks.
  
### 2. ✅ Integrate Jenkins for CI/CD (5 Points)
We established a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. The following steps were taken:

- **Pipeline Configuration:** We configured a Jenkins pipeline to automatically build and test the project upon code committed to the main branch. The pipeline includes the following stages:
  - **Code Checkout:** The pipeline retrieves the latest code from the Git repository.
  - **Build:** The pipeline compiles the code using Maven.
  - **Unit Tests:** The pipeline executes the unit tests using JUnit.
  - **Code Coverage:** The pipeline generates code coverage reports using JaCoCo.


### 3. ✅ Automated Unit & Coverage Testing
We expanded our unit test suite to cover new and existing features, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

- **Test Suite Extension:** We wrote unit tests for the newly implemented features, focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions.
- **JaCoCo Integration:** We continued using JaCoCo for code coverage analysis, ensuring that the Jenkins pipeline generates and publishes the JaCoCo HTML report.
- **Report Publication:** The Jenkins pipeline automatically publishes the JaCoCo HTML report to a designated location, making it accessible to the team. (Optional)

### 4. ✅ Functional Review Readiness
We ensured that the application is ready for a functional review, with all main features implemented and testable.

- **End-to-End Functionality:** The application functions end-to-end, allowing users to complete all core workflows.
- **Feature Completeness:** All main features are implemented and can be demonstrated.
- **Backend and Frontend Integration:** The backend and frontend are fully integrated and functional.

### 5. ✅ Develop and test the Docker image in the local machine (1 points)
- Create and test the initial docker image of the project using Docker desktop

### 6. ✅ Prepare for Sprint Review
We prepared for the sprint review by gathering evidence of completed tasks and preparing a demonstration of the working prototype.

- **Demonstration Preparation:** We prepared a demonstration of the fully working prototype, highlighting the extended features and the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
- **Jenkins CI/CD Demonstration:** We will demonstrate the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline in action, showcasing the build, test, and report generation processes.
- **Code Coverage Report Presentation:** We will present the updated code coverage report, highlighting the areas of the codebase that are well-tested and areas that require further testing.
- **Demonstrate that the docker image is working locally**
- **Team Contribution Evidence:** We gathered evidence of team contributions and individual tasks completed, including commit logs, task assignments, and meeting notes.
- **GitHub Updates:** Updated the project repository with the latest code, documentation, and configuration files.
- **Trello/Jira Updates:** Updated Trello/Jira boards to reflect the progress made during the sprint, including task completion status and remaining tasks.
