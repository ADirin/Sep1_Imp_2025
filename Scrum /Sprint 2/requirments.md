# Sprint 2 Tasks  
**AD/ 2025**

----------------------------------------------------------------
## ⚠️  NOTE FOR STUDENTS:  
- <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">In this course, the focus is more on the process of developing the product than on the final product itself.</span> Don’t worry about trying to build everything in a single sprint, that’s not the goal.  
- <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">The lecturer will take the role of Product Owner.</span> At the end of each sprint, your work will be reviewed during a dedicated Zoom session for each team, and all team members are expected to participate in the review session.
- Despite assigning points to each task, this does not mean that a team can choose some tasks and ignore others just to earn passing points. The team must implement all tasks defined in the requirements for each sprint.
- Lectures help you implement the tasks smoothly, so it is highly recommended to attend them and complete the in-class assignments.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡Objective of the sprint2
 
The primary objective of this sprint is to lay the foundation for the application by:  
- Implementing the database  
- Initiating the user interface development  
- Integrating essential development tools such as **unit testing**, **Maven dependencies**, and **code coverage reporting**  

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Sprint 2 Scrum Master Tasks

- The **Scrum Master** will oversee team participation, AI application use, backlog updates, Sprint 1 review preparation, and Sprint 2 planning submission.

- While teams are free to determine their own approach for Sprint 2, the following examples are provided for guidance. The prioritization and sequencing of tasks will be established by the Scrum Master in collaboration with the development team.  

---------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅🔹 Implementing the Database (2 points)
- **Design Database Schema**: Based on the product requirements, design and create the database schema (entities, attributes, relationships).  
- **Database Technology**: Utilize the selected database technology (e.g., MariaDB).  
  - *Note*: For database localization efforts in OTP2, ensure the use of a **relational database**.  
- **Create Tables/Collections**: Define tables (or collections) with fields and relationships to represent the data model.  
- **Seed with Sample Data (Optional)**: Populate the database with sample data for testing and development.  
- **CRUD Testing**: Verify that Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations function correctly.  

---

### ✅🔹 Start Developing the User Interface (2 points)
- **Frontend Development**: Begin frontend development, referencing the **Figma design**.  
- **Initial Views/Screens**: Implement screens that align with product vision and user stories.  
- **Layout and Interactivity**: Focus on layout and basic interactive elements.  

---

### ✅🔹 Integrate Unit Testing (3 points)
- Write unit tests for key backend and frontend functions.  
- Follow best practices for naming, structure, and clarity.  
- Ensure tests are included in the project repository.  

---


### ✅🔹 Configure Code Coverage Testing (3 points)
- **Use JaCoCo**: Integrate to generate coverage reports.  
- **Run Tests Regularly**: Track coverage and identify gaps.  
- **Meaningful Coverage**: Focus on critical functionalities and complex logic.  
- **Export and Publish Report**: Export HTML report and publish it to a public folder (e.g., university web server).  

---

### 📝🔹 Prepare for Sprint Review
- **Demonstration Readiness**: Be ready to present:  
  - Database structure and data  
  - Progress on user interface  
  - Unit tests in action  
  - Maven dependency management and build process  
  - Publicly available JaCoCo coverage report  
- **Individual Contributions**: Each member must articulate their contributions.  
- **Update GitHub**: Commit all changes and updates.  
- **Update Trello/Jira**: Reflect progress and task status.
