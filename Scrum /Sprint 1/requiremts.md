**Amir Dirin / F2025**  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE FOR STUDENTS:  
- <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">In this course, the focus is more on the process of developing the product than on the final product itself.</span> Don‚Äôt worry about trying to build everything in a single sprint, that‚Äôs not the goal.  
- <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">The lecturer will take the role of Product Owner.</span> At the end of each sprint, your work will be reviewed during a dedicated Zoom session for each team, and all team members are expected to participate in the review session.
- Despite assigning points to each task, this does not mean that a team can choose some tasks and ignore others just to earn passing points. The team must implement all tasks defined in the requirements for each sprint.
