# Sprint 1 Tasks (19.08-02.09)  
**Amir Dirin / F2025**  

## Sprint 1 Objective (10 Points)  
Establish the project team, choose a topic, define the project vision, and set up the tools along with the initial product backlog.  

**NOTE FOR STUDENTS:**  
- In this course, the focus is more on the process of developing the product than on the final product itself. Don’t worry about trying to build everything in a single sprint, that’s not the goal. Instead, we’ll be practicing Agile and Scrum methods, along with tools like CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes while implementing the project.  
- The lecturer will take the role of Product Owner. At the end of each sprint, your work will be reviewed during a dedicated Zoom session for each team, and all team members are expected to participate in the review session.

## Sprint Tasks

### 1. Form a Project Team
- Assemble a team of up to 4 students and update the group-setup form that is shared during the lecture.  
- Decide on your communication and collaboration tools between the group members (e.g., Discord, Teams, WhatsApp).  

### 2. Select a Project Topic
- Choose a project topic for your team to implement during SEP1 and continue in SEP2.  
- If you decide on your own topic, make sure it is realistic and achievable within the course timeline. Discuss the topic with the teacher before starting the implementation.  

### 3. Create a Product Vision (3 Points)
- Write a clear vision statement that describes (one A4 page):  
  - What are the target product’s functionalities.  
  - Who are the target users, stakeholders, role players?  
  - What problem it solves and how it creates value for customers.  
  - Who are the design and development team?  
  - What is the timeline to deliver the functional prototype?  
*(See a sample report shared in Moodle site)*  

### 4. Discuss and Select Technologies
**Note:** All lecture examples, demonstrations, and compulsory assignments are in Java. If you choose to use other technologies, the lecturer cannot provide support. Your final project must meet all course requirements.  

- As a team, research and decide which technologies you will use, including:  
  - Frontend ()  
  - Backend ()  
  - Database ()  
  - Other tools or frameworks (e.g., authentication, APIs)  
- Document your chosen technology stack and explain the reasoning behind your decisions in the project’s GitHub README (see Task 5).  

### 5. Set Up a Project Management Tool (3 Points)
- Choose either **Jira** or **Trello**:  
  - Create your workspace and invite all team members and the lecturer.  
  - Set up your product backlog (See Task 6) and the first sprint board.  
- Create a **GitHub repository** for your project:  
  - Update the project topic, team name, selected technology, and methodology (Agile).  
  *(See demonstration of sample GitHub setup)*  

### 6. Create the Initial Product Backlog (2 Points)
- List the main features and tasks needed for your project.  
- Prioritize them based on importance and feasibility.  
- Keep the backlog flexible so it can be refined in later sprints.  
- Write user stories using the format:  
  - `As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].`  
  - **Example:**  
    - `As a student, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.`  

### 7. Design the Application UI (2 Points)
- Create a folder in your GitHub repository named **Documents** and upload all your designs there.  
- Design the application UI using **Figma** and share it during the Sprint 1 review with the teacher.  
- Design the initial database architecture and include it in the same folder.
