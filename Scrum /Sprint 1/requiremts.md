## Sprint 1 Objective (10 Points)

The objective of **Sprint 1** is to establish a project team, select a project topic, define the product vision and project plan, and set up project management tools along with the initial product backlog.

---

## Important Notes for Students

- The primary focus of this course is on the **process of product development**, rather than the final product itself. Students are **not expected to build a complete system in a single sprint**.
- The course emphasizes **Agile and Scrum practices**, as well as tools such as **CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes**, during project implementation.
- The lecturer will act as the **Product Owner**. At the end of each sprint, teams will participate in a **Sprint Review session via Zoom**.  
  **Attendance is mandatory**, and each team member must clearly present their **individual contribution**.

---

## Sprint 1 Tasks

### 1. Form a Project Team
- Assemble a team of up to **four (4) students** and complete the group setup form shared during the lecture.
- Decide on communication and collaboration tools (e.g., Discord, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp).

---

### 2. Select a Project Topic
- Choose a project topic to be implemented during **SEP1** and continued in **SEP2**.
- If proposing a custom topic, ensure it is **realistic and achievable** within the course timeline.  
  Students are strongly encouraged to **discuss the topic with the lecturer** before implementation.

### 3. Create a Product Vision (2 Points)
Prepare a clear **Product Vision document** (maximum **one A4 page**) covering:

*(See the instruction.)*  https://github.com/ADirin/Sep1_Imp_2025/blob/main/Week1/Home%20Assignmetn/Project_Vision.md

### 4. Create the Project Plan (3 Points)
*(see the instruction)* https://github.com/ADirin/Sep1_Imp_2025/edit/main/Week1/Home%20Assignmetn/Project_Plan.md

---

### 5. Technology Selection
- Discuss and select the technologies to be used in the project.

> **Note:** All lecture examples and compulsory assignments are based on **Java**.  
> If alternative technologies are used, the lecturer cannot guarantee technical support.

- The selected technology stack must **fully meet the course requirements**.  
  Statements such as *“our chosen technology does not support feature X”* will **not be accepted** and may negatively affect your grade.
- Document the chosen technology stack and the rationale behind your decisions in the **project GitHub README**.
- The technology stack must include:
  - Frontend
  - Backend
  - Database
  - Additional tools or frameworks (e.g., authentication, APIs)

---

### 6. Set Up Project Management Tools (1 Point)
- Select either **Jira** or **Trello**.
- Create a workspace and invite **all team members and the lecturer**.
- Set up the **product backlog** and the **first sprint board**.
- Create a GitHub repository and add a folder named **`Documents`** for future design artifacts.

---

### 7. Create the Initial Product Backlog (1 Point)
- Identify key features and tasks.
- Prioritize items based on importance and feasibility.
- Write user stories using the following format:

```text
As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit].
````

### 8. Prepare Topic Presentation (3 Points)
- Prepare a 25-minute presentation based on the shared classroom presentation topics.
- The presentation schedule will be announced one week in advance.
- At the end of the presentation, prepare two discussion questions for classmates to answer.

### Optional Early Implementation
If time permits:
1. Design the application UI using Figma and present it during the Sprint 1 review.
2. Design the initial database architecture and include it in the Documents folder.

### Sprint Review Meeting
The Sprint 1 _Review Meeting_ is scheduled two weeks after the first lecture (Week 3, 2026).
Attendance by all team members is mandatory.
