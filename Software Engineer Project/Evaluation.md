# Course Evaluation Scheme (Final Grade: 0–5)

**Grading scale:**  
- **0.0 = Fail**  
- **5.0 = Maximum score**

The course project is completed in **teams** and divided into **four sprints**, each lasting **two weeks**.  
Teams must submit a **Sprint Review Report** at the end of each sprint.  
At the end of the course, students must submit a **Self & Peer Review** evaluating individual contributions.

## Overview of Weighting

| Component | Max Internal Points | Weight | Contribution to Final Grade |
|----------|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Sprint Tasks (4 sprints) | 40 (10 × 4) | 60% | 3.0 |
| Final Project Outcome (Team) | 10 | 20% | 1.0 |
| Self & Peer Review (Individual) | 10 | 20% | 1.0 |
| **Total** | — | **100%** | **5.0** |

---

## 1. Sprint Tasks (4 Sprints) — **0–3.0 points**

- The project consists of **4 sprints**
- Each sprint task is graded on a **0–10 point scale**
- Each sprint contributes **0–0.75 points** to the final course grade

### Sprint Contribution Formula

Sprint Contribution = (Sprint Score / 10) × 0.75


### Example Conversion

| Sprint Score (0–10) | Course Points |
|--------------------|---------------|
| 10 | 0.75 |
| 8 | 0.60 |
| 6 | 0.45 |
| 5 | 0.38 |
| 0 | 0.00 |

### Sprint Review Evaluation Criteria

- Achievement of sprint goals
- Quality and completeness of deliverables
- Team collaboration and task distribution
- Reflection on challenges and improvements
- Clarity and quality of the sprint report

---

## 2. Final Project Outcome (Team) — **0–1.0 point**

- Graded on a **0–10 point scale**
- Same initial score applies to all team members

### Conversion Formula
Final Project Contribution = (Final Project Score / 10) × 1.0

### Evaluation Criteria

- Functional correctness and completeness
- Technical quality
- Compliance with project requirements
- Quality of final presentation or demonstration

---

## 3. Self & Peer Review (Individual) — **0–1.0 point**

- Graded on a **0–10 point scale**
- Evaluates **individual contribution** within the team

### Conversion Formula
Self & Peer Review Contribution = (Peer Review Score / 10) × 1.0


### Evaluation Criteria

- Level of individual contribution
- Quality of work delivered
- Collaboration and communication
- Responsibility and reliability
- Consistency between self and peer evaluations

## Penalty Rules (Applied Before Grade Conversion)

| Situation | Penalty Applied |
|---------|----------------|
| Sprint report submitted up to 24h late | −10% of sprint score |
| Sprint report submitted 24–72h late | −30% of sprint score |
| Sprint report submitted more than 72h late | Sprint score = 0 |
| Missing sprint submission | Sprint score = 0 |
| Individual contribution < 50% of sprint workload | Individual sprint score = 0 |
| Absent from sprint review meeting (no approved reason) | Individual sprint score = 0 |
| Final project submitted late (≤ 48h) | −20% of final project score |
| Final project not submitted | Final project score = 0 |
| No self & peer review submitted | Self & peer review score = 0 |

### Notes
- Sprint participation and attendance are **mandatory**.
- Individual penalties may **override team sprint scores** where applicable.
- Approved absences must be **documented in advance**.

------------------------
## Final Grade Calculation

Final Course Grade =
Σ (Sprint_i / 10 × 0.75) +
(Final Project / 10 × 1.0) +
(Self & Peer Review / 10 × 1.0)

- **Maximum grade:** 5.0  
- **Minimum grade:** 0.0 (Fail)

---

## Pass / Fail Rule (Optional)

- **Final Grade < 3.0 → Fail**
- **Final Grade ≥ 3.0 → Pass**

## Notes

- Peer review may be used to **adjust individual grades** if contributions differ significantly.
- Failure to submit sprint reports or peer reviews may result in **zero points** for that component.
