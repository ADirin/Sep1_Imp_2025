# Course Introduction: Software Engineering Project

- Welcome to the  Software Engineering project course! This project-based course provides a comprehensive introduction to software engineering principles, with a focus on practical application through a series of weekly lectures, quizes, Home and in-class assignment in addition to **project assignments.**
- The course is designed to equip you with essential skills in **software development**, **project management**, and **agile methodologies**.


## Relavent Textbook specially for the first two weeks  
- The electronic version of the course textbook:  
  **Ian Sommerville, *Software Engineering*, 10th edition**  
- The official glossary of Software Engineering terminology by IEEE  

## Lectures  
- Weekly face-to-face lectures  
- Lectures primarily focus on the **software development process**.  
- Examples used in the lectures are predominantly in **Java**.  
- Participation in the face-to-face lectures is highly recommended specially inclass assignment.
- Complementary weekly Quizes  

## Project Assignment  
The project in this course is designed to impart knowledge of software engineering and the project development lifecycle. This includes:  
- **Requirments analysis**
- **Software architectural planning**  which you must do during software modling course which will be     implemented at the same time as software engineering project course
- **Design**  such as FIGMA, 
- **Implementation** "AI-based code is not accepted in any form"
- **Testing**
- **Documentation**

**NOTE:** *The focus is *NOT* on the final product but rather on the process employed to achieve the project goals, which is a *functional product*. Therefore, it is advised to follow the lectures closely and carefully adhere to the sprint requirements each week.*
